# JugglinDan's Collection of Macros for the Foundry VTT

It's a mixed bag, both in terms of quality and functionality, driven by my need for utility and curiosity to learn some JavaScript and the Foundry API.

The `snippets` folder contains uncategorised stuff that I want to remember. Once the amount of related material there reaches a critical mass, I'll move it to a named folder.

> [!NOTE]
> If you came here looking for the [Dragonbane Timekeeping scripts](./deprecated-dbtime/dbtime-readme.md), just click through to the DB Time Readme.
> However, please note that these scripts are deprecated and no longer supported.
>
> I highly recommend you use my [Easy Timekeeping](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/jd-easytimekeeping) module instead if you want to track the time in your Foundry game.
> It does everything the scripts did and more, is easier to install, and has far fewer bugs.
