/*
A macro for the Foundry virtual tabletop.

Part of the Dragonbane Time collection.

This macro is called when the time has changed.
Unlike the stretch, hour, shift, and day change macros which are only called when those particular 
clocks have changed, this script is always called when the time is changed in any way.
