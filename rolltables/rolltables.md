# Roll All In Folder

This Foundry macro calls all the rolltables in a folder once and formats the results into a chat message.

Given a folder of results like this:

![A folder of roll tables in Foundry VTT](./sl-tables.jpg)

It will produce output like:

![A formatted Foundry chat message showing the output of the macro](./sl-output.jpg)

It's not anything you can't do by rolling individually on all the tables, but it's a lot faster and more convenient.
Note that I won't be distributing any content for the tables. You'll need to own the books and supply your own.
